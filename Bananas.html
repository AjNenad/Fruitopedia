          <p>The Cavendish banana is your “typical” banana found at the local grocery store or 
            farmer’s market. They are slightly sweet and have a creamy texture. 
            They have various stages of ripening, from green to yellow, to yellow with brown spots.
             They’re grown all across Central America, and their production is essential to the 
             economies in these areas.

          <p>Pisang Raja bananas are popular in Indonesia. Featuring a yellow to orange color, 
            they taste like honey-flavored custard with a smooth and creamy consistency.
            They’re slightly smaller than Cavendish Bananas, averaging four to six inches in length.

          <p>As their name suggests, red bananas have a reddish-purple skin. 
            They have light pink colored flesh and are much sweeter and softer than 
            Cavendish bananas. They also have a slight raspberry flavor that makes them absolutely
           irresistible.

          <p>Blue Java bananas are also known as the ice cream banana due to their sweet vanilla 
            flavor and extreme creaminess. They feature a beautiful blue peel and a white flesh. 
            They’re actually pretty hardy and can grow in colder regions.
