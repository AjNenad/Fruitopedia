  <h1>Exotic Fruits</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Star Fruit (Carambola)</li>
        <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/11_exotic_fruits_you_should_try_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_star_fruit_carambola.jpg?resize=652px:*&output-quality=75" width="80" height="80">
          <p>A waxy, sweet/tart fruit that tastes of citrus, apple, and plum, star fruit hails from Southeast Asia.
             It turns golden yellow when ripe. Each has less than 40 calories but plenty of fiber and vitamin C. 
             Just wash, slice, and eat -- no need to peel or seed. It's a stellar addition to salads and shines as a garnish.
            But avoid it if you have kidney problems. Star fruit has kidney stone-forming oxalic acid.

      <li>Dragon Fruit (Pitaya)</li>

          <p>Dragon fruit grows on a cactus that originates in Central and South America. 
            Don't eat the skin, which is scaly (like a dragon's) and yellow or pink. 
            Scoop out the crunchy, pink or white flesh with a spoon. 
            It's full of tiny black seeds and tastes like kiwi or pear. Eat as is, or add to cocktails or desserts. 
            Dragon fruit offers plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and may even help keep your gut bacteria healthy.

      <li>Guava</li>

          <p>Guavas are thought to have originated in Central and South America. 
            Juicy, sweet, and acidic, they might remind you of strawberries and pears. 
            The edible rind can be white, yellow, pink, or red. Some guavas are seedless. 
            Others have pale, edible seeds. One guava has more vitamin C than an orange, 
            along with vitamin A, fiber, potassium, and phosphorus. Use them in juices, jams, and desserts. 
          </p>

      <li>Passion Fruit</li>
        <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/11_exotic_fruits_you_should_try_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_passion_fruit.jpg?resize=652px:*&output-quality=100" width="80" height="80">
          <p>Fragrant and purple, red, or yellow, passion fruit hails from South America. 
            Spanish missionaries named it for its plant's five-petaled flower, 
            which they saw as symbols of Christ's injuries in the crucifixion. 
            It tastes similar to guava. It's rich in potassium and fiber, 
            with just 17.5 calories per fruit. Slice one in half, then scoop out and eat the seeds 
            and pulp. Or strain the pulp and enjoy as juice or in a sauce.
