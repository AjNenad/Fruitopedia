  <h1>Apples</h1>

          <p>Originally cultivated in Japan (they’re named for Mt. Fuji), 
            these yellow and red apples are very sweet with just a hint of tartness, 
            and they’re crisp and firm. They’re perfect for snacking and as a sweet addition to salads. 
            Also, because they hold their shape, Fujis are also good for pies, tarts and other baked goods.

          <p>One of the most popular varieties in the U.S., Galas are very sweet, 
            with a lightly floral aroma. Crisp and juicy, Galas have a faintly striped pattern, 
            with a mix of red and yellow on the skin. They’re perfect for snacking and salads, 
            as well as baking, such as inside muffins and pies.

          <p>These green apples are a favorite for their crisp, mouth-puckeringly tart flavor, 
            and their versatility. Slice and eat out of hand (they’re especially good paired with cheese), 
            or use them in sauce, pies, cakes, muffins and other treats.

          <p>The prom queen of apples, this iconic variety is deep red, with an elongated shape and sweet, 
            juicy flesh. Red Delicious are best for fresh applications such as snacking and salads; 
            they don’t hold up well to baking or cooking.
          </p>

      <li>Golden Delicious</li>
        <img src="https://parade.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTkwNTgxNDY1MzY4ODk3NDA0/golden-delicious-apple-jpg.webp" width="80" height="80">
          <p>Its deep yellow hue gives this popular variety away. 
            With straightforwardly sweet flesh that’s reminiscent of honey, 
            Golden Delicious works both as a snack or in a salad, as well as baked into pies, 
            tarts, cakes or other treats.

          <p>As the name indicates, these apples are a cross between Jonathan and Golden Delicious,
             and their color pattern reflects that, with a mix of blush red and greenish gold. 
             Its pale yellow flesh is sweet and tart, with hints of the honey flavor and aroma 
             that come from its Golden Delicious roots. This versatile variety works well in baked 
             treats as well as sauces, or enjoy one as a snack or chopped up in a salad.

          <p>Pale yellow Ginger Gold apples are crisp, firm, lightly sweet with a slightly tart 
            edge and hints of spice. They’re more complex and crunchier than the super-sweet 
            Golden Delicious. Slice for snacks (they won’t brown right away), add to salads, 
            cook into sauce or bake into your favorite treats.
