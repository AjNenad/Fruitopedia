          <p>Navel oranges are one of the most popular kinds of oranges out there. 
            They are prized for their high vitamin C content, low acid content, and delectable sweetness. 
            They’re known by the small growth at the bottom of the fruit, which resembles a human navel. 
            When you peel them, you’ll uncover a tiny “mini orange” at the bottom of the fruit.
             Another feature that makes navel oranges appealing is that they’re seedless. 
             They’re also easy to peel and are loaded with sweet juice.

          <p>The blood orange stands out from every other type of orange due to its bright red flesh. 
            Blood oranges are also smaller than navel oranges but a bit bigger than tangerines. 
            Blood oranges have a unique flavor that tastes somewhat of oranges mixed with raspberries. 
            They are relatively easy to peel, but are very juicy. They’re great for making salads, 
            sauces, and marmalade. They’re also great for juicing.

          <p>Smaller in size and sweeter than the typical orange, tangerines are also very popular. 
            They have a soft and thin skin, making them easier to peel than a typical navel orange. 
            They’re known by their deep orange skin and flesh and are very high in vitamin C.

      <li>Bergamot Orange</li>

          <p>Bergamont oranges have a yellow or green color similar to a lime, but are the size of an orange. 
            They have a intensely bitter and acidic taste and aren’t typically eaten. 
            Instead, these oranges are grown primarily for their peel, which is used in perfumes 
            and as a flavor for Earl Grey tea.
